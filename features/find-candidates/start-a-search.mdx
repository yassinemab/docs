Our AI-powered search process helps you find the most qualified candidates by analyzing your job description and creating intelligent search parameters. Here's how to get started:

## Step 1: Upload Your Job Description
Begin by uploading your job description. Our AI will analyze the content to understand:
- Required skills and qualifications
- Experience level needed
- Key responsibilities
- Industry-specific requirements

## Step 2: Customize AI Search Filters
After analyzing your job description, our AI generates smart search filters that you can fine-tune:

- **Keywords**: Important keywords relevant for the position
- **Job titles**: We generate a list of job titles that are similar to the given job title
- **Experience Level**: We interpret the experience level needed for the position
- **Industry Focus**: We identify the industry the position belongs to
- **Location**: We determine the location of the position
- **Education**: We specify the education level required for the position

<Tip>
  Take time to review and adjust these filters - they form the foundation of your candidate search and directly impact your results.

## (Optional) Step 3: Define Requirements
Next, you'll see AI-generated requirements based on your job description. For each requirement, you can:

- **Customize Criteria**: Edit or add specific requirements
- **Set Importance**: Assign weights (1-5) to each requirement
- **Add Context**: Provide additional details for more accurate matching

If you don't want to add any requirements, you can click the button on the bottom to skip this step.

<Note>
  The more precise your filters and requirements, the more targeted your candidate matches will be. You can always adjust these parameters later if needed.
